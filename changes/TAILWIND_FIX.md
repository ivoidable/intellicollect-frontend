# Tailwind CSS v4 to v3 Downgrade Fix

**Date:** September 18, 2025
**Issue:** PostCSS plugin compatibility error with Tailwind CSS v4

## Problem
Tailwind CSS v4 requires `@tailwindcss/postcss` as a separate package, which was causing build errors in the Next.js development server.

## Solution
Downgraded from Tailwind CSS v4 to v3 for better compatibility with the current Next.js setup.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Changes
```bash
# Removed
- "tailwindcss": "^4.1.13"
- "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.1.13"

# Added
+ "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17"
```

### 2. PostCSS Configuration
Updated `postcss.config.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},  // Back to v3 syntax
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 3. Tailwind Config
Updated `tailwind.config.ts`:
- Changed darkMode from `"class" as const` to `["class"]`
- Removed `satisfies Config` type assertion
- Kept all other configurations intact

## Verification
- Development server runs successfully on port 3001
- All styles render correctly
- No build errors
- All components work as expected

## Benefits of v3
- More stable and mature
- Better compatibility with existing tooling
- Extensive plugin ecosystem
- Well-documented migration paths

## Future Considerations
When ready to upgrade to Tailwind CSS v4:
1. Install `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
2. Update PostCSS configuration
3. Review breaking changes in v4 documentation
4. Test all components thoroughly

## Current Working Version
- Tailwind CSS: 3.4.17
- PostCSS: 8.5.6
- Autoprefixer: 10.4.21
- Next.js: 15.5.3
